# Bashell
Bashell is a browser-based terminal window with a difference.

Bashell is a browser-based terminal window that accepts a wide range of predefined commands from the user as an input and produces the output in the window itself.
Bashell runs entirely on JavaScript. 

## To get started

Type the command *help* to see a list of commands that Bashell accepts along with a description of what it does.

## Plans ahead

Working on adding console based games as a part of Bashell and making it easier for other developers to contribute their JavaScript
console game to Bashell.

## Issues and solutions

As Bashell is being tested by different people on different environments, new issues will surface, if any and I will start working
on them. This [Wiki](https://github.com/ClydeDz/Bashell/wiki/Issues-and-solutions) tracks the identified bugs/ issues and lists whether it is resolved or not
and details the solution if its resolved.
